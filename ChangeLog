        * rtai-lab/scilab/rtmain.c: Support for continous blocks
        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: RTAICodeGen_.sci modified and compatible with 
	  Scilab-3.1 CVS with support for continous blocks
	  Added subdirectory "RT_templates" for tmemplate Makefiles
	  Added New function "SetTarget_.sci" to handle template Makefile and
	  continous code generation.

	* configure.in: stop configuring if Linux REGPARMS is set.

2005-05-18  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/include/rtai_malloc.h: practically break any constraint in
	  dynamic memory allocation.

        * base/sched/sched.immed: 
	  - changed coding of circular pending lists,
	  - pending wake up macro transferred to rtai_schedcore.h,
	  - parametrised give_back_to_linux to distinguish between raw
	    use and internal hard/soft transitions following Linux use,
	  - use ADEOS virq directly for waking up Linux tasks from RTAI.
        * base/sched/api.c: sleeping tasks wake up substituted with the more
	  general rt_task_masked_unblock, so that it becomes just a #define 
	  subcase of it.
        * base/sched/sys.c: cares of the paremetrised give_back_to_linux.
        * base/arch/i386/hal.immed: 
	  - cleaned unused/useless stuff,
	  - layout restyling,
	  - old cpu affinity state is saved no more, as it could wrongly 
	    restate an unintended mask in case of repeated calls, user must
	    care of it; to such an aim the set affinity function return the
	    previous state,
	  - optional stalling of the RTAI domain in hard mode, under control
	    of the STALL_RTAI_DOMAIN macro,
        * base/include/asm-i386/rtai_hal.immed: changes to support consistency 
	  when STALL_RTAI_DOMAIN is used.
        * base/include/rtai_schedcore.h: defines pending wake up macros for
	  any need. 
        * testsuite/kern/latency/, testsuite/user/latency/: output conforming
	  to 3.2, i.e with overall count of periodic reschedules displayed
	  also.

        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: Added new blocks

2005-04-27  Panagiotis Issaris <panagiotis.issaris@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* testsuite/{user,kernel}/{latency,preempt}/display.c: output is now 
	in tabular format and output uses the same units for each test.
	* testsuite/user/latency/display.c: show overall maximum latency.

2004-04-20  Roberto Bucher  <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>

        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: Scicos ports are now set automatically
	* rtai-lab/scilab/devices/*: library files modified for port set automatically
	* rtai-lab/scilab/example/tes.cos: Modifies with the new scicos blocks

2004-04-13  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

        * begin new development cycle, aligning to stable vulcano.
