2005-01-14  Paolo Mantegazza <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/sched/api.c: return the registration count when a named and
	  counted object is deregistered; before this fix the registration
	  index was returned (N.B.: error introduced with the new hashed
	  registration).

2005-01-13  Paolo Mantegazza <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/include/rtai_usi.h: coded atomic_cmpxchg specifically for

	  work also with RTDM based 16550A.

2005-12-22  Roberto Bucher  <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>

        * rtai-lab/matlab/rtmain.c: Applied patch from Marco Romagnoli and
	  modification from Paolo Mantegazza.

2005-12-22  Paolo Mantegazza <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* addons/rtdm/module.c: all functions made 0 type, RTDM cares to

	  LXRT calls.

2005-12-20  Paolo Mantegazza <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	  immediate mode.

2005-11-23  Paolo Mantegazza <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* /addons/fusion/drivers/16550A: 16550A.c fixed a likely bug in
	  config setting (this could turn to just a reminder for something 
	  else).

	  for absolute timeouts.
	* /addons/fusion/skins/rtdm/xn.h: use RTAI proper kernel lock in

	  x86 task priority registers: in switching back and forth Linux, 
	  inline and macro for anything a user might want to do on her/his
	  own, utility to initialise high irqs Linux does not know; requires
	  local APIC.
	* base/arch/i386/hal/hal.*: uses taskpri when enabled.
	* base/sched/sched.c: uses taskpri when enabled.

2005-09-06  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/sched/sched.c: changed oneshot programming to improve 
	  latencies for relatively long time span firings with uncalibrated 
	  frequencies, by introducing sub time steps also when the APIC 
	  timer is used.

	  not MAX_SLOTS macro, they differ in hashed registry.
	* base/sched/api.c: added a missing loop over registered objects to be
	  released at task existing, export max_slots, clean unused code.

2005-08-16  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* include/asm-i386/rtai_lxrt.h: got rid of the long time unused local

          unwrapped ADEOS event catching; depends on the definition of the
	  macro "UNWRAPPED_CATCH_EVENT", to be defined in rtai_hal.h.
	* base/include/asm-i386/rtai_hal.immed: enabled macro to use 
	  unwrapped event catching.
	* base/arch/i386/patches: modified handle_event to avoid wrapping
	  event and related data.

        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/RTAICodeGen_.sci: Added checks for the
	dialog box values
        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/SetTarget_.sci: Added checks for the
	dialog box values
	

2005-05-24  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/include/asm/rtai_hal.immed: do not double marking in hard 
	  real time, in cpu_realtime, the depth count is more than enough.
	* base/arch/i386/hal/hal.immed: lock out Linux directly from 
	  interrupt handlers; avoid dispatching irqs completely.
	* base/sched/sched.immed: care of avoiding Linux locking when done
	  in irq handler already, enable immediate sched on ipi without
	  dispatching.

2005-05-23  Roberto Bucher  <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>

        * rtai-lab/scilab/rtmain.c: Support for continous blocks
        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: RTAICodeGen_.sci modified and compatible with 
	  Scilab-3.1 CVS with support for continous blocks
	  Added subdirectory "RT_templates" for tmemplate Makefiles
	  Added New function "SetTarget_.sci" to handle template Makefile and
	  continous code generation.

2005-05-18  Philippe Gerum  <rpm@xenomai.org>

	* configure.in: stop configuring if Linux REGPARMS is set.

2005-05-18  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

	* base/include/rtai_malloc.h: practically break any constraint in
	  dynamic memory allocation.

2005-05-13  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

        * base/sched/sched.immed: 
	  - changed coding of circular pending lists,
	  - pending wake up macro transferred to rtai_schedcore.h,
	  - parametrised give_back_to_linux to distinguish between raw
	    use and internal hard/soft transitions following Linux use,
	  - use ADEOS virq directly for waking up Linux tasks from RTAI.
        * base/sched/api.c: sleeping tasks wake up substituted with the more
	  general rt_task_masked_unblock, so that it becomes just a #define 
	  subcase of it.
        * base/sched/sys.c: cares of the paremetrised give_back_to_linux.
        * base/arch/i386/hal.immed: 
	  - cleaned unused/useless stuff,
	  - layout restyling,
	  - old cpu affinity state is saved no more, as it could wrongly 
	    restate an unintended mask in case of repeated calls, user must
	    care of it; to such an aim the set affinity function return the
	    previous state,
	  - optional stalling of the RTAI domain in hard mode, under control
	    of the STALL_RTAI_DOMAIN macro,
        * base/include/asm-i386/rtai_hal.immed: changes to support consistency 
	  when STALL_RTAI_DOMAIN is used.
        * base/include/rtai_schedcore.h: defines pending wake up macros for
	  any need. 
        * testsuite/kern/latency/, testsuite/user/latency/: output conforming
	  to 3.2, i.e with overall count of periodic reschedules displayed
	  also.

2005-05-03  Roberto Bucher  <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>

        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: Added new blocks

2005-04-27  Panagiotis Issaris <panagiotis.issaris@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* testsuite/{user,kernel}/{latency,preempt}/display.c: output is now 
	in tabular format and output uses the same units for each test.
	* testsuite/user/latency/display.c: show overall maximum latency.

2005-04-20  Roberto Bucher  <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>

        * rtai-lab/scilab/macros/RTAI/*: Scicos ports are now set automatically
	* rtai-lab/scilab/devices/*: library files modified for port set automatically
	* rtai-lab/scilab/example/tes.cos: Modifies with the new scicos blocks

2005-04-13  Paolo Mantegazza  <mantegazza@aero.polimi.it>

        * begin new development cycle, aligning to stable vulcano, i.e. 3.2.
