LXRT has 16 extensions slots.

Those already used by modules found in this distributions are:
0  - RTAI itself (hardwired),
1  - tasklets    (hardwired),
9  - comedi,
10 - fifos,
14 - serial,
15 - rtdm.

So you can reuse the above slots only if you are not using the related modules
found in this distribution. 
In any case check the value returned by: set_rt_fun_ext_index.

N.B. (hardwired) above means they are assumed as basic RTAI proper extensions.
Nonetheless extension 1 do check if it can install in its hardwired slot,
exiting their installation in error, by using back doors installed in LXRT. 
So you can use the related slot if tasklets is not being used by your 
applications, __NEVER__ use 0. In any case you'd better use the other many 
free slots available to avoid any trouble.
