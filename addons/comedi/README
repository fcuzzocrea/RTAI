		      <*> RTAI_KCOMEDI IN USER SPACE <*>

This porting of KCOMEDI to user space is done using the standard extension 
feature of LXRT and makes KCOMEDI symmetrically usable in kernel and user 
space within RTAI, in soft/hard real time. To use KCOMEDI in user space you 
have just to know how to use it in kernel space. So whatever space you are 
going to work in it will be the same mostly.

There are nonetheless a few points forbidding the above statements to be 
true unconditionally.

One is related to a couple of name returning functions: 
"comedi_get_driver_name" and "comedi_get_board_name".

In kernel space the requested name is simply got by returning a pointer to 
a directly addressable global namestring, which is useless in user space. 
So there is the need of copying the namestring available in kernel space to 
user space, thus the calling convention must be changed. So the following 
two aliases, usable both in kernel and user space, have been made available:
void *rt_comedi_get_driver_name(unsigned int dev, char *name);
void *rt_comedi_get_board_name(unsigned int dev, char *name);
On success both of them return the requested name in "name", NULL otherwise.

The solution of the above problem is simple and, almost, compulsory. 
In fact the only real problem to be solved for a symmetric approach to 
KCOMEDI in kernel and user space has been the use of a callback function 
in user space for which a fairly general, but frozen, usage scheme has 
been devised.

The callback method made available is based on using a built in callback 
function that triggers an rt_task_resume and allows returning back to the 
user the important unsigned long mask, made available by the standard COMEDI 
callback support as its first argument.

The related support comes from using the following function, not needed but 
available in kernel space also (if you'll like it):
int rt_comedi_register_callback(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, unsigned int 
mask, int (*callback)(unsigned int, void *), void *task);
- the first 3 arguments are the same as in "comedi_register_callback" while
  "callback" is discarded and "task" is the pointer to an RTAI task that
  waits for asynchronous events to happen. NULL can be used in place of 
  "task", if it is the current one, in which case RTAI will care of setting 
  it appropriately.

For compatibility reasons the standard COMEDI: 
int comedi_register_callback(unsigned int minor, unsigned int subdev, 
unsigned int mask, int (*cb)(unsigned int, void *), void *arg); 
is also available in user space in the form of a macro that redirects it to 
"rt_comedi_register_callback", setting "cb" to NULL while "arg" should have 
assigned either the pointer to the task to be used or NULL. 
As said there is clearly no need for anything similar in kernel space as the 
original COMEDI function is available directly, but the user space approach 
might prove viable and easier to use in kernel space also.

After the COMEDI callback has been initialized a user could synchronize its
application with COMEDI asynchronous events by using any of the following 
functions, usable in kernel space also naturally:

long rt_comedi_wait(long *cbmask);
- this function waits for the callback unconditionally; cbmask is a compulsory
  non NULL pointer to a variable that will receive the callback mask of the
  events that triggered it.

long rt_comedi_wait_if(long *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but returns immediately 
  if no COMEDI event has been signaled yet. Useful for polling COMEDI events, 
  through the returned long mask, without blocking.

long rt_comedi_wait_until(RTIME until, long *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but features an absolute 
  timeout, given by "until".

unsigned long rt_comedi_wait_timed(RTIME delay, long *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but features a relative 
  timeout, given by "delay".

- The returned value can be:
- 0 if the callback succeeded,
- a negative number, in which case its absolute value indicates wait overruns;
- an RTAI error if >= RTE_BASE.

It is likely that the illustrated callback scheme and synchronization is 
better exploited by using a thread acting as an asynchronous COMEDI events 
manager in hard real time. However it is by no means the only way as the 
above wait functions can be used anywhere and rt_comedi_wait_if makes it 
possible an easy implementation of a polling scheme.

Once woken up from wait one can call:
long rt_comedi_command_data_read (void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nsampl, 
lsampl_t *data);
to get "nsampl" samples in "data". Notice that data are read only if nsampl
elements are available, nothing being done otherwise. Such a condition can
be checked through the returned value which will be the number of available
sampled data, so that a return value less than than "nsampl" will mean nothing 
has been read. The return value can be RTE_OBJINV also, in the case of 
dev/subdev being wrong.

A typical code sample could be:

	long mask, avbs;
.
	comedi_register_callback(dev, subdev, COMEDI_CB_EOS, NULL, task);
.
	if (rt_comedi_wait_timed(nano2count(TIMEOUT), &mask) != 0) {
		printf("waiting for async data failed\n");
	}
.
	if (mask & COMEDI_CB_EOS) {
		if ((avbs = rt_comedi_command_data_read(dev, subdev, NCHAN, data)) != NCHAN) {
			printf("only %ld channels data available in place of %d, nothing read\n", avbs, NCHAN);
		}
.
	}
.

Calling an rt_comedi_wait followed by rt_comedi_command_data_read is OK and
let the user do whatver check (s)he needs. Nonetheless it has the disadvantage
of taking two trips to kernel space. Since what is mostly required is a
succesfull rt_comedi_wait with a mask containing the appropriate user expected
callback mask the two calls can be unified. Such a scheme is mostly useful in 
a digital controller where a single call paces its action in such a way that 
at each sampling time one is ready to apply her/his control low on the 
available samples immediatly.

To that end RTAI makes available the following:
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nsampl, lsampl_t *data, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_if(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nsampl, lsampl_t *data, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_until (void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nsampl, lsampl_t *data, RTIME until, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_timed(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nsampl, lsampl_t *data, RTIME delay, long *mask);
whose arguments are the union of the previous calls, with mask containing
the event markers that must be found set in the callback mask returned by the 
COMEDI callback.

The previous code snippet would become:

	long mask, avbs;
.
	comedi_register_callback(dev, subdev, COMEDI_CB_EOS, NULL, task);
.
	mask = COMEDI_CB_EOS);
	if ((avbs = rt_comedi_command_data_wread_timed(dev, subdev, NCHAN, data, nano2count(TIMEOUT), &mask)) != NCHAN) {
		printf("only %ld channels data available in place of %d, or an error occured, nothing read\n", avbs, NCHAN);
	}
.

There is an example in RTAI "showroom" CVS, "user/comedi" that should help
in depicting the use of the above explained extensions.

Finally the function:
int rt_comedi_do_insnlist(void *dev, comedi_insnlist *ilist);
has been added, symmetrically in kernel/user space as usual.
It is an exact image of its parent:
int comedi_do_insnlist(void *dev, comedi_insnlist *list);
which is not available in KCOMEDI; that's why we prefixed it with an "rt_".
The simple reason of its missing in kernel space is because it will add just 
the overhead of a call more to obtain something that a user can have directly
by executing repeated "comedi_do_insn" in her/his own way. From user space 
instead the overhead of calling "comedi_do_insn" many times could be much more
significant so it is might help in having the possibility of executing a whole
instruction list in a single shot only.

A final warning: all KCOMEDI functions are executed without the comedi_lock
being activated. That's because it adds some, albeit neglegible on nowadays 
machines, overhaed and because in control system it is rare to have possible
conficting functionalities shared among more tasks. If a locked execution is
needed nonetheless then the user must explicitly configure this extensio for
that, in which case it will be applied to all services.
