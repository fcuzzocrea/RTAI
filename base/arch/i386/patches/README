Being it useless to duplicate ADEOS patches, easily found at ADEOS home site:

http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/

they are not to be found in RTAI distributions anymore.

So here you'll find just the modified ADEOS versions needed to use RTAI 
immediate mode for interrupts dispatching.

It must be noticed that the patches found here allow to work in standard 
piped ADEOS mode also.
