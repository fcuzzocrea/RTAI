These are RTAI own patches but they can be used also as any of their standard 
ADEOS counterpart, the opposite being not true.

FOR COMEDI USERS:
patches for 2.4.32/2.6.13/2.6.14 do not contain a config parameter that is 
understood by COMEDI.
In order to allow using the most recent patches with COMEDE here is a suggestion from Roberto Bucher <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>:

"in order to compile the COMEDI drivers for RTAI-3.3, the user must simply add 
the line:
 
CONFIG_RTHAL=y

to the .config file in the kernel directory. This should solve temporarily the 
problem.

The COMEDI "configure" file is looking for "CONFIG_RTHAL" or "CONFIG_ADEOS" in 
the ".config" kernel file."
