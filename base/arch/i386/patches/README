Being it useless to duplicate ADEOS patches, easily found at ADEOS home site:

http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/

they are not to be found in RTAI distributions anymore.

The version of ADEOS is not critical. Any of the recent versions should
work, but in regard to stability and bug-fixes, it is recommended to use
the latest version available.

Accordingly here you'll find just the latest modified ADEOS versions needed 
to use RTAI immediate mode for interrupts dispatching.

It must be noticed that the patches found here allow to work in standard 
piped ADEOS mode also.
