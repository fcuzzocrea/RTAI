	for UP, unless you have the local APIC enabled, i.e. an SMP
	machine with just one CPU mounted on the motherboard.  It is a
	fully symmetric scheduler, where at task init all real time
	tasks default to using any available cpu.

config RTAI_SCHED_MUP
	bool "Multi-UP scheduler for SMP machine (kernel tasks only)"
	default n

	help
	Multi-Uniprocessor is a pseudo-SMP implementation where
	several virtual processors are going to be served by a single
	physical CPU. The system is therefore able to support several
	scheduling queues or pseudo-timers.

	RTAI offers an implementation of an MultiUniProcessor (MUP)
	realtime scheduler to be interfaced to the RTAI module. It is
	based on the local APIC timers. It can be profitably used on
	MP machines with just one CPU mounted on the motherboard.

	The advantage of using the MUP scheduler comes mainly from the
	possibility of using mixed timers simultaneously,
	i.e. periodic and oneshot, where periodic timers can be based
	on different periods, and of possibly forcing critical tasks
	on the CPU cache

	All the fuctions of UP and SMP schedulers are available in the
	MUP scheduler, as well as MUP specific functions can be used
	under UP-SMP.

config RTAI_SCHED_LXRT
	bool "LXRT scheduler (kernel and user-space tasks)"
	default y
	help

	LXRT is a user-space interface providing a symmetric API that
	may be used by both real-time RTAI tasks and linux
	processes. The full range of Linux system calls is then
	available and transitions between "soft" real-time and "hard"
	real-time can be performed.

	As far as scheduling is concerned, LXRT requires the use of
	SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy with statically assigned process
	priorities to achieve "soft" real-time performance whilst in
	user-space. Since LXRT provides the faculty to switch an
	application process to real-time, a real-time agent task is
	created and executes the real-time services on behalf of the
	LXRT process. 
	
	The NEWLXRT scheduler unifies U/MP and kernel/user space by
	scheduling Linux tasks/kernel threads natively, along with
	RTAI kernel tasks, all in one. In fact, NEWLXRT brings
	something new: a linux hard real-time application interface
	that is totally based on the scheduling of Linux tasks and
	kernel threads only. The NEWLXRT implementation doesn't need
	any RTAI proper task to be supported.

	help
	Event flags are used to synchronize a task with the occurrence
	of multiple events. This synchronization may be disjunctive
	when any of the events have occurred or conjunctive when all
	events have occured. The former corresponds to a logical OR
	whereas the latter is associated to a logical AND.  Their use
	is similar to semaphores' except that signal/waits are not
	related to just a simple counter but depends on the

config RTAI_FIFOS

	Originally fifos were used to allow communication between

	availability of LXRT, fifos are kept for both compatibility
	reasons and because they are very useful tools to be used to

	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra

	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls

	Linux processes.
	The module will be called rtai_shm.o.

config RTAI_SEM
	tristate "Semaphores"
	default m
	help

	A semaphore is a protocol mechanism offered to:
	  - control access to a shared resource (mutual exclusion);
	  - signal the occurrence of an event;
	  - allow two tasks to synchronize their activities.

	Resource semaphores can be recursively nested and support full
	priority inheritance, both among semaphore resources and
	intertask messages, for a singly owned resource.

	Priority inheritance becomes an adaptive priority ceiling when
	a task owns multiple resources, including messages sent to it.
	Both binary and counting semaphores are able to queue tasks
	either in FIFO or priority order and this can be chosen
	dynamically at run time.

	The module will be called rtai_sem.o.

	help

	A mailbox corresponds to a pointer-size variable which is
	associated to a service provided by the kernel. It allows a
	task or an ISR to deposit a message (the pointer) into this
	mailbox.

	The RTAI mailbox implementation is very flexible as it allows
	to send any message size by using any mailbox buffer
	size. They are based on the First In First Out (FIFO)
	principle and on Last In First Out (LIFO) for urgent delivery.

	Mailboxes depend on semaphores.

	The module will be called rtai_mbx.o.

	Typed mailboxes (TBX) are an alternative to the default RTAI
	mailboxes. They offer:

	1- message broadcasting allowing to send a message to all the
	   tasks that are pending on the same TBX;

	2- urgent sending of messages: these messages are not
	   enqueued, but inserted in the head of the queue, bypassing all
	   the other messages already present in TBX;

	3- a priority or fifo wakeup policy that may be set at runtime
	when creating the typed mailbox.

	Typed mailboxes depend on semaphores.

	RTAI's malloc support offers two different ways to allocate

	- it doesn't have the size restriction of kmalloc.

	The reasons for using kmalloc:
	- it is faster;

config RTAI_TASKLETS
	tristate "Tasklets"
	default m
	help

	The tasklets module adds an interesting new feature along the
	line, pioneered by RTAI, of a symmetric usage of all its
	services inter-intra kernel and user space for both soft and
	hard real-time. The new services provided can be useful when
	you have many tasks, both in kernel and user space, that must
	execute in hard real-time but do not need any RTAI scheduler
	services that could lead to a task block.

	Such tasks are called tasklets and can be of two kinds:
        - a simple tasklet;
        - timed tasklets (timers).

	The tasklets implementation of timed tasklets relies on a
	server support task that executes the related timer functions,
	either in oneshot or periodic mode, on the base of their time
	deadline and according to their user assigned priority.

	As explained above, plain tasklets are just functions executed
	from kernel space. Their execution needs no server and is
	simply triggered by calling the user specified tasklet
	function at due time, either from a kernel task or interrupt
	handler in charge of their execution when they are needed.

	The module will be called rtai_tasklets.o.

config RTAI_TRACE
	bool "LTT support"
	default n

	Originally, the Linux Trace Toolkit is a suite of tools
	designed to extract program execution details from the Linux
	operating system and interpret them. Specifically, it enables
	to extract processor utilization and allocation information
	for a certain period of time. It is then possible to perform
	various calculations on this data and dump this in a text
	file. This tool is enhanced by a GTK GUI which allows an easy
	exploitation of those results.  The Linux Trace Toolkit has
	been natively integrated into RTAI modules.

	RTAI already contains some examples hinting at managing
	interrupts in user space, e.g: resumefromintr in lxrt-net_rpc,
	pressa in lxrt, but all of them require installing a proper
	handler in kernel space to wake up a hard real-time
	LXRT/NEWLXRT task.

config RTAI_WD
	bool "Watchdog support"
	default y
	help

	The purpose of the watchdog is to provide protection services
	to RTAI thereby protecting it (and the host Linux OS) against
	programming errors in RTAI applications.

	The RTAI module and a scheduler should be mounted to use the
	watchdog and once mounted, it will constantly monitor periodic
	real-time tasks that already exist, or that are created later.
	However this feature is optional and it is assumed that your
	RTAI applications are well behaved so that RTAI should behave
	the same whether or not you have the watchdog mounted. The
	overhead imposed by the watchdog depends on the speed that you
	run it, but in most cases should be minimal.

	The following watchdog policies are possible:
	- do nothing other than log some messages and keep a record of
	  the bad task; 
	- resynchronise the task's frame time and nothing more;
	- debug policy which is a special case of the above
	  resynchronisation policy; 
	- stretch the period of the offending task until it no longer
	  overruns; 
	- slip the offending task by forcibly suspending it for a
	  percentage of its period; 
	- suspend the offending task so that it no longer threaten the system;
	- kill the offending task and remove all traces.
