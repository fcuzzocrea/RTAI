Here is what RTAI POSIX uses to support to allow you to use plain POSIX names.
It is an excerpt from "man ld" read it all there, even if all what of interest
is copied below.

.....
       --wrap symbol
           Use a wrapper function for symbol.  Any undefined reference to 
           symbol will be resolved to "__wrap_symbol". Any undefined reference
           to "__real_symbol" will be resolved to symbol.

           This  can  be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
           wrapper function should be called "__wrap_symbol".  If it wishes to
           call the system function, it should call "__real_symbol".

           Here is a trivial example:

                   void *
                   __wrap_malloc (size_t c)
                   {
                     printf ("malloc called with %zu\n", c);
                     return __real_malloc (c);
                   }

           If you link other code with this file using --wrap malloc, then all
           calls to "malloc" will call the function  "__wrap_malloc"  instead.
           The  call  to "__real_malloc" in "__wrap_malloc" will call the real
           "malloc" function.

           You may wish to provide a "__real_malloc" function as well, so that
           links  without the --wrap option will succeed.  If you do this, you
           should not put the definition of "__real_malloc" in the  same  file
           as  "__wrap_malloc";  if you do, the assembler may resolve the call
           before the linker has a chance to wrap it to "malloc".
.....

In case you suspect the need to use a __real POSIX-something function you should
know that it should happen just for the functions listed in POSIX_WRAPS, found 
in this subdirectory.
