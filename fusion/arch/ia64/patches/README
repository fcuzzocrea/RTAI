-- arch/ia64/patches

RTAI/fusion needs special kernel support to deliver fast and
deterministic response time to external interrupts, and also to
provide real-time services highly integrated with the standard Linux
kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply to a vanilla kernel tree,
before you attempt to compile the RTAI/fusion codebase against the
latter kernel.

Apply one of the patches found in this directory to the corresponding
kernel release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the RTAI/fusion tree for more information.
