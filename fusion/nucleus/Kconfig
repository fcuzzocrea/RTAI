config RTAI_OPT_FUSION
	bool "Real-time support in user-space"
	default y
	help

	Enable all real-time features for user-space Linux
	processes, which is the default operating mode for
	RTAI/fusion. Switching this option out only leaves the
	minimal support needed for running in-kernel
	applications, which directly call the real-time APIs from
	kernel modules.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	bool "Inter-domain pipe support"
	default y
	help

	Inter-domain pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication
	channels allowing data exchange between nucleus threads
	and regular user-space processes. Pipes natively preserve
	message boundaries, but can also be used in byte stream mode
	from kernel to user space.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV
	string "Number of pipe devices"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	default 32
	help
	
	This option sets the maximum number of pipe devices supported
	in the system. Pipe devices are named /dev/rtpN where N is a
	device minor number ranging from 0 to RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.

config RTAI_OPT_TRACES
        bool "Trace support"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_EXPERT
        default n
        help

        When activating this option, a module named rtai_trace is compiled,
        which offers a watchdog service (Adeos based, so that no particular
        hardware support is needed) and allows to record trace events.

        The traced events may then be seen through the /proc/rtai/traces
        file, or when unloading the module, and are displayed when the watchdog
        detects that a CPU is stuck.

config RTAI_OPT_DEBUG
	bool "Debug support"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	
	This option activates runtime checking of the Xenomai
	nucleus state.

config RTAI_OPT_TIMESTAMPS
	bool "Execution timestamps"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	
	This option causes various timestamps to be taken during
	the in-kernel execution. Those are likely to be used by
	profiling code in order to chase excessive jitter.
