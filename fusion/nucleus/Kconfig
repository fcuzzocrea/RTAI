config RTAI_OPT_FUSION
	bool "Real-time support in user-space"
	default y
	help

	Enable all real-time features for user-space Linux
	processes, which is the default operating mode for
	RTAI/fusion. Switching this option out only leaves the
	minimal support needed for running in-kernel
	applications, which directly call the real-time APIs from
	kernel modules.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	bool "Inter-domain pipe support"
	default y
	help

	Inter-domain pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication
	channels allowing data exchange between nucleus threads
	and regular user-space processes. Pipes natively preserve
	message boundaries, but can also be used in byte stream mode
	from kernel to user space.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV
	string "Number of pipe devices"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	default 32
	help
	
	This option sets the maximum number of pipe devices supported
	in the system. Pipe devices are named /dev/rtpN where N is a
	device minor number ranging from 0 to RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.
