config RTAI_OPT_FUSION
	bool "Real-time support in user-space"
	default y
	help

	Enable all real-time features for user-space Linux
	processes, which is the default operating mode for
	RTAI/fusion. Switching this option out only leaves the
	minimal support needed for running in-kernel
	applications, which directly call the real-time APIs from
	kernel modules.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	bool "Message pipes"
	default y
	help

	Message pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication
	channels allowing data exchange between real-time kernel
	threads and regular user-space processes. Pipes natively
	preserve message boundaries, but can also be used in byte
	streaming mode from kernel to user-space.

config RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV
	string "Number of pipe devices"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_PIPE
	default 32
	help
	
	This option sets the maximum number of pipe devices supported
	in the system. Pipe devices are named /dev/rtpN where N is a
	device minor number ranging from 0 to RTAI_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.

config RTAI_OPT_SYS_HEAPSZ
	string "Size of the system heap (Kb)"
	default 128
	help

	The system heap is used for various internal allocations by
	the nucleus and the real-time skins. The size is expressed in
	Kilobytes.

config RTAI_OPT_DEBUG
	bool "Debug support"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	
	This option activates runtime checking of the real-time
	nucleus state.

config RTAI_OPT_WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog support"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	
	This option activates a watchdog aimed at detecting runaway
	real-time threads. If enabled, the watchdog triggers after 4
	seconds of uninterrupted real-time activity without Linux
	interaction; in such event, the current real-time thread is
	forcibly suspended. The built-in watchdog support operates on
	behalf of the timer tick handler, thus is only active after
	the timer has been started.

config RTAI_OPT_EXPERT_PERCPU_TIMER
        bool "Per-cpu timers list"
        default y
        help

        This option make the nucleus timer module use one timers list
        by CPU, this reduces the need for inter-CPU communication and
        should significantly reduce the scheduling latency on other CPUs
        than the first one. This option has no effect on uniprocessor
        machines.

config RTAI_OPT_SCALABLE_SCHED
	bool "O(1) scheduler"
	default n
	help
	
	This option causes a multi-level priority queue to be
	used in the real-time thread scheduler, so that it operates
	in constant-time regardless of the number of _concurrently
	runnable_ threads (which might be much lower than the total
	number of active threads). Its use is recommended for
	large multi-threaded systems involving more than 10 of such
	threads; otherwise, the default linear method usually performs
	better with lower memory footprints.

config RTAI_OPT_SCALABLE_PRIOS
	string "Number of priority levels"
	depends on RTAI_OPT_SCALABLE_SCHED
	default 256
	help

	This option sets the maximum number of priority levels available
	within the scalable scheduler's multi-level queue. This value
	must be higher or equal than the maximum priority range which
	could be required for running the real-time skin used by the
	application. For instance, the native RTAI skin needs a
	hundred priority levels.

	When LTT support is active, this option disables tracepoints
	inside real-time interrupt handlers.

config RTAI_OPT_FILTER_EVTHR
	bool "Disable thread-related tracepoints"
	default y if RTAI_OPT_FILTER_EVALL=y
	help
	
	When LTT support is active, this option disables tracepoints
	inside most thread-related services.

config RTAI_OPT_FILTER_EVSYS
	bool "Disable syscall-related tracepoints"
	default y if RTAI_OPT_FILTER_EVALL=y
	help
	
	When LTT support is active, this option disables tracepoints
	inside the shadow syscall dispatcher.

config RTAI_OPT_FILTER_EVALL
	bool "Disable all tracepoints"
	default n
	help
	
	This option disables all LTT tracepoints inside RTAI/fusion.
