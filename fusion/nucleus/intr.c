 * \brief Initialize an interrupt object.
 *
 * Associates an interrupt object with an IRQ line.
 *
 * When an interrupt occurs on the given @a irq line, the ISR is fired
 * in order to deal with the hardware event. The interrupt service
 * code may call any non-suspensive service from the nucleus.
 *
 * Upon receipt of an IRQ, the ISR is immediately called on behalf of
 * the interrupted stack context, the rescheduling procedure is
 * locked, and the interrupt source is masked at hardware level. The
 * status value returned by the ISR is then checked for the following
 * bits:
 *
 * - XN_ISR_ENABLE asks the nucleus to re-enable the IRQ line. Over
 * some real-time control layers which mask and acknowledge IRQs, this
 * operation is necessary to revalidate the interrupt channel so that
 * more interrupts can be notified. The presence of such bit in the
 * ISR's return code causes the nucleus to ask the real-time control
 * layer to re-enable the interrupt.
 *
 * - XN_ISR_CHAINED tells the nucleus to require the real-time control
 * layer to forward the IRQ. For instance, this would cause the Adeos
 * control layer to propagate the interrupt down the interrupt
 * pipeline to other Adeos domains, such as Linux. This is the regular
 * way to share interrupts between the nucleus and the host system. At
 * the opposite, RT_INTR_HANDLED can be used instead to indicate that
 * the interrupt request has been fulfilled.
 *
 * A count of interrupt receipts is tracked into the interrupt
 * descriptor, and reset to zero each time the interrupt object is
 * attached. Since this count could wrap around, it should be used as
 * an indication of interrupt activity only.
 *
 * @param intr The address of a interrupt object descriptor the
 * nucleus will use to store the object-specific data.  This
 * descriptor must always be valid while the object is active
 * therefore it must be allocated in permanent memory.
 *
 * @param irq The hardware interrupt channel associated with the
 * interrupt object. This value is architecture-dependent. An
 * interrupt object must then be attached to the hardware interrupt
 * vector using the xnintr_attach() service for the associated IRQs
 * to be directed to this object.
 *
 * @param isr The address of a valid low-level interrupt service
 * routine if this parameter is non-zero. This handler will be called
 * each time the corresponding IRQ is delivered on behalf of an
 * interrupt context.  When called, the ISR is passed the descriptor
 * address of the interrupt object.
 *
 * @param flags A set of creation flags affecting the operation. Since
 * no flags are currently defined, zero should be passed for this
 * parameter.
 *
 * @return No error condition being defined, 0 is always returned.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: never.
