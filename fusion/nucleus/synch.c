 * \fn void xnsynch_init(xnsynch_t *synch, xnflags_t flags);
 * \brief Initialize a synchronization object.
 *
 * Initializes a new specialized object which can subsequently be used
 * to synchronize real-time activities. The RTAI/fusion nucleus
 * provides a basic synchronization object which can be used to build
 * higher resource objects. Nucleus threads can wait for and signal
 * such objects in order to synchronize their activities.
 *
 * This object has built-in support for priority inheritance.
 *
 * @param synch The address of a synchronization object descriptor the
 * nucleus will use to store the object-specific data.  This
 * descriptor must always be valid while the object is active
 * therefore it must be allocated in permanent memory.
 *
 * @param flags A set of creation flags affecting the operation. The
 * valid flags are:
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_PRIO causes the threads waiting for the resource to pend
 * in priority order. Otherwise, FIFO ordering is used (XNSYNCH_FIFO).
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_PIP causes the priority inheritance mechanism to be
 * automatically activated when a priority inversion is detected among
 * threads using this object. Otherwise, no priority inheritance takes
 * place upon priority inversion (XNSYNCH_NOPIP).
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: never.
