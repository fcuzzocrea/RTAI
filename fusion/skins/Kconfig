	help

	RTAI/vm technology allows applications based on legacy RTOS
	APIs to run inside virtual machines in user-space
	with hard real-time capabilities.
	If activated, this option will cause in-kernel emulators
	which have been selected in the current menu to be
	compiled as process-embeddable virtual machines too.
