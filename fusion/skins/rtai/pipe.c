 * Message pipe services.
 *
 * Message pipes are an improved replacement for the legacy
 * RT-FIFOS. A message pipe is a two-way communication channel between
 * RTAI tasks and standard Linux processes using regular file I/O
 * operations on a pseudo-device. Pipes can be operated in a
 * message-oriented fashion so that message boundaries are preserved,
 * and also in byte streaming mode from real-time to standard Linux
 * processes for optimal throughput.
 *
 * RTAI tasks open their side of the pipe using the rt_pipe_create()
 * service; standard Linux processes do the same by opening one of the
 * /dev/rtpN special devices, where N is the minor number agreed upon
 * between both ends of each pipe. Additionally, named pipes are
 * available through the registry support, which automatically creates
 * a symbolic link from entries under /proc/rtai/registry/pipes/ to
 * the appropriate special device file.

 * @fn int rt_pipe_create(RT_PIPE *pipe,const char *name,int minor)
 * @brief Create a message pipe.
 *
 * This service opens a bi-directional communication channel allowing
 * data exchange between RTAI tasks and standard Linux
 * processes. Pipes natively preserve message boundaries, but can also
 * be used in byte stream mode from RTAI tasks to standard Linux
 * processes.
 *
 * rt_pipe_create() always returns immediately, even if no Linux
 * process has opened the associated special device file yet. On the
 * contrary, the non real-time side could block upon attempt to open
 * the special device file until rt_pipe_create() is issued on the
 * same pipe from a RTAI task, unless O_NONBLOCK has been specified to
 * the open(2) system call.
 *
 * @param pipe The address of a pipe descriptor RTAI will use to store
 * the pipe-related data.  This descriptor must always be valid while
 * the pipe is active therefore it must be allocated in permanent
 * memory.
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * message pipe. When non-NULL and non-empty, this string is copied to
 * a safe place into the descriptor, and passed to the registry
 * package if enabled for indexing the created pipe.
 *
 * Named pipes are supported through the use of the registry. When the
 * registry support is enabled, passing a valid @a name parameter when
 * creating a message pipe subsequently allows standard Linux
 * processes to follow a symbolic link from
 * /proc/rtai/registry/pipes/@a name in order to reach the associated
 * special device (i.e. /dev/rtp*), so that the specific @a minor
 * information does not need to be known from those processes for
 * opening the proper device file. In such a case, both sides of the
 * pipe only need to agree upon a symbolic name to refer to the same
 * data path, which is especially useful whenever the @a minor number
 * is picked up dynamically using an adaptive algorithm, depending on
 * the current system configuration.
 *
 * @param minor The minor number of the device associated with the pipe.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the system fails to get enough dynamic
 * memory from the global real-time heap in order to register the
 * pipe.
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if the @a name is already in use by some
 * registered object.
 *
 * - -ENODEV is returned if @a minor is not a valid minor number for
 * the pipe special device (i.e. /dev/rtp*).
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if @a minor is already open.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an
 * asynchronous context.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.

 *
 * - -EWOULDBLOCK is returned if @a timeout is equal to TM_NONBLOCK
 * and no data is immediately available on entry.
