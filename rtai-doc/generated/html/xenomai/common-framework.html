<a name="rtos-behaviours"></a>1.3.1. Common traditional RTOS behaviours</h4></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>In order to build a generic and versatile framework for
	emulating traditional RTOS, we chose to concentrate on a set
	of common behaviours they all exhibit. A limited set of
	specific RTOS features which are not so common, but would be
	more efficiently implemented into the nucleus than into the
	emulators, has also been retained. The basic behaviours
	selected cover four distinct fields:</p>
<div class="sect4" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h5 class="title">
<a name="multi-threading"></a>1.3.1.1. Multi-threading</h5></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>Multi-threading provides the fundamental mechanism for
	  an application to control and react to multiple, discrete
	  external events. The nucleus provides the basic
	  multi-threading environment.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Thread states.</em></span> The nucleus has to
	  maintain the current state of each thread in the system. A
	  state transition from one state to another may occur as the
	  result of specific nucleus services called by the RTOS
	  emulator. The fundamental thread states defined by the
	  nucleus are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>DORMANT and SUSPENDED states are cumulative,
		meaning that the newly created thread will still
		remain in a suspended state after being resumed from
		the DORMANT state.</p></li>
<li><p>PENDING and SUSPENDED states are cumulative too,
		meaning that a thread can be forcibly suspended by
		another thread or service routine while pending on a
		synchronization resource (e.g. semaphore, message
		queue). In such a case, the resource is dispatched to
		it, but it remains suspended until explicitely resumed
		by the proper nucleus service.</p></li>
<li><p>PENDING and DELAYED states may be combined to
		express a timed wait on a resource. In such a case,
		the time the thread can be blocked is bound to a limit
		enforced by a watchdog.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
	</p>
<p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Scheduling policies</em></span>. By default,
	  threads are scheduled according to a fixed priority value,
	  using a preemptive algorithm. There is also a support for
	  round-robin scheduling among a group of threads having the
	  same priority, allowing them to run during a given time
	  slice, in rotation. Moreover, each thread undergoing the
	  round-robin scheduling is given an individual time
	  quantum.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Priority management.</em></span> It is
	  possible to use whether an increasing or decreasing thread
	  priority ordering, depending on an initial configuration. In
	  other words, numerically highest priority values could
	  whether represent highest or lowest scheduling priorities
	  depending on the configuration choosen. This feature is
	  motivated by the existence of this two possible ordering
	  among traditional RTOS. For instance, VxWorks, VRTX, ThreadX
	  and Chorus O/S use a reversed priority management scheme,
	  where the highest the value, the lowest the priority. pSOS+
	  instead uses the opposite ordering, in which the highest the
	  value, the highest the priority.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Running thread.</em></span> At any given
	  time, the highest priority thread which has been ready to
	  run for the longuest time among the currently runnable
	  threads (i.e. not currently blocked by any delay or resource
	  wait) is elected to run by the scheduler.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Preemption.</em></span> When preempted by a
	  more prioritary thread, the running thread is put at front
	  of the ready thread queue waiting for the processor
	  resource, provided it has not been suspended or blocked in
	  any way. Thus it is expected to regain the processor
	  resource as soon as no other prioritary activity (i.e. a
	  thread having a higher priority level, or an interrupt
	  service routine) is eligible for running.</p>
<p>Manual round-robin.<span class="emphasis"><em></em></span> As a
	  side-effect of attempting to resume an already runnable
	  thread or the running thread itself, this thread is moved at
	  the end of its priority group in the ready thread
	  queue. This operation is functionally equivalent to a manual
	  round-robin scheduling.</p>
<p>Even if they are not as widespread as those above in
	  traditional RTOS, the following features are also retained
	  for the sake of efficiency in the implementation of some
	  emulators:</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Priority inversion.</em></span> In order to
	  provide support for preventing priority inversion when using
	  inter-thread synchronization services, the priority
	  inheritance protocol is supported.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Signaling.</em></span> A support for sending
	  signals to threads and running asynchronous service routines
	  to process them is available. The asynchronous service
	  routine is run on behalf of the signaled thread context the
	  next time it returns from the nucleus level of execution, as
	  soon as one or more signals are pending.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Disjunctive wait.</em></span> A thread is
	  able to wait in a disjunctive manner on multiple
	  resources. The nucleus unblocks the thread when at least one
	  among the pended resources is available.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h5 class="title">
<a name="thread-synchro"></a>1.3.1.2. Thread synchronization</h5></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>Traditional RTOS provide a large spectrum of
	  inter-thread communication facilities involving thread
	  synchronization, such as semaphores, message queues, event
	  flags or mailboxes. Looking at them closely, we can define
	  the characteristics of a basic mechanism which will be
	  usable in turn to build these facilities.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Pending mode.</em></span> The thread
	  synchronization facility provides a mean for threads to pend
	  either by priority or FIFO ordering. Multiple threads should
	  be able to pend on a single resource.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Priority inheritance protocol.</em></span> In
	  order to prevent priority inversion problems, the thread
	  synchronization facility implements a priority inheritance
	  protocol in conjunction with the thread scheduler. The
	  implementation allows for supporting the priority ceiling
	  protocol as a derivative of the priority inheritance
	  protocol.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Time-bounded wait.</em></span> The thread
	  synchronization facility provides a mean to limit the time a
	  thread waits for a given resource using a watchdog.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Forcible deletion.</em></span> It is legal to
	  destroy a resource while threads are pending on it. This
	  action resumes all waiters atomically.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h5 class="title">
<a name="it-management"></a>1.3.1.3. Interrupt management</h5></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>Since the handling of interrupts is one of the least
	  well defined areas in RTOS design, the nucleus focuses on
	  providing a simple mechanism with sufficient hooks for
	  specific implementations to be built onto according to the
	  emulated RTOS flavour.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Nesting.</em></span> Interrupt management
	  code is reentrant in order to support interrupt nesting
	  safely.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Atomicity.</em></span> Interrupts are
	  associated with dedicated service routines called ISRs. In
	  order for these routines not to be preempted by thread
	  execution, the rescheduling procedure is locked until the
	  outer ISR has exited (i.e. in case of nested
	  interrupts).</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Priority.</em></span> ISRs is always
	  considered as prioritary over thread execution. Interrupt
	  prioritization is left to the underlying
	  hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h5 class="title">
<a name="time-management"></a>1.3.1.4. Time management</h5></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>Traditional RTOS usually represent time in units of
	  ticks. These are clock-specific time units and are usually
	  the period of the hardware timer interrupt, or a multiple
	  thereof. Since it needs to support both periodic and
	  aperiodic time sources, the nucleus transparently switches
	  from periodic jiffies to time-stamp counter values depending
	  on the current timer operating mode.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Software timer support.</em></span> A
	  watchdog facility is provided to manage time-bound
	  operations by the nucleus.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Absolute and relative clock.</em></span> The
	  nucleus keeps a global clock value which can be set by the
	  RTOS emulator as being the system-defined epoch.</p>
<p>Some RTOS like pSOS+ also provide support for
	  date-based timing, but conversion of ticks into conventional
	  time and date units is an uncommon need that should be taken
	  in charge by the RTOS emulator itself. </p>

<a name="abstraction-layer"></a>1.3.2. An architecture-neutral abstraction layer</h4></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>After having selected the basic behaviours shared by
	traditional RTOS, we have implemented them in a nucleus
	exporting a few service classes. These generic services will
	then serve as a founding layer for developing each emulated
	RTOS API, according to their own flavour and semantics.</p>
<p>In order for this layer to be architecture neutral, the
	needed support for hardware control and real-time capabilities
	will be obtained from an underlying host software
	architecture, through a rather simple standardized
	interface. Thus, porting the nucleus to a new real-time
	architecture will solely consist in implementing this
	low-level interface for the target platform.</p>

<a name="rt-capabilities"></a>1.3.3. Real-time capabilities</h4></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>The host software architecture is expected to provide
	the primary real-time capabilities to the RTOS abstraction
	layer. Basically, the host real-time layer must handle at
	least the following tasks: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Start/stop dispatching on request the external
	      interrupts to a specialized handler ;</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a mean to mask and unmask interrupts ;
	      </p></li>
<li><p>Provide a mean to create new threads of control in
	      their simplest form ; </p></li>
<li><p>Provide support for periodic and aperiodic
	      interrupt sources used in timer management ; </p></li>
<li><p>Provide support for allocating chunks of
	      non-pageable memory.</p></li>

</div>
<p>Xenomai aims at helping application designers relying on
	traditional RTOS to move as smoothly as possible to a
	GNU/Linux-based execution environment, without having to
	rewrite their applications entirely. Aside of the advantages
	of using GNU/Linux as an embedded system, the benefits
	expected from the described approach is mainly a reduced
	complexity in designing new RTOS emulations. The
	architecture-neutral abstraction layer provides the foundation
	for developing accurate emulations of traditional RTOS API,
	saving the burden of implementing each time their fundamental
	real-time behaviours. Since the abstraction layer also favours
	code sharing and mutualization, we can expect the RTOS
	emulations to take advantage of them in terms of code
	stability and reliability.</p>
