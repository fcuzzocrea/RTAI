This directory contains the support for modifing the Scilab/Scicos code 
generation, so that it can be used within RTAI user space soft/hard real time
and monitered with RTAI-Lab.

Please refer to the online manual "RTAI-LaRTAI-Lab tutorial: Scilab, Comedi, and real-time control"
available at the RTAI-Lab repository.

After installing RTAI and RTAI-Lab simply go in the folder "macros" and run:

1) make install (as superuser)
2) the each scilab user must run "make user" to install the startup script.
