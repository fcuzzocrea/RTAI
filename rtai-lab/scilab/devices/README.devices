Writing new devices for Scilab/Scicos
=====================================

Use the utility "gen_dev" to create a skeleton of the file for your
new device. The needed procedures are added to the include file "devices.h" too.

Example:
gen_dev rtai_comedi_data

This command creates a file "rtai_comedi_data.c" and fill the
procedures into "device.h"

Now simply add the code to the generated file in order to fit your need.

Start "Makefile" to generate the library "ulibsci.a" and "make
install" to copy this library into the rtai-scilab path (default: /usr/local/scicos").
