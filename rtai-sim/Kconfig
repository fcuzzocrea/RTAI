config RTAI_MVM

	default n
	help

	RTAI includes a Minute Virtual Machine (MVM) associated to the
	Xenomai sub-system.

	Using the MVM to run your real-time applications has a lot of
	advantages: it is faster, it does not require
	cross-development tools, gives extended debugging, monitoring
	and tracing features and provides an easy way to stress the
	application under test with run-time situations otherwise
	barely conceivable on a real target (e.g. bursts of simulated
	interrupts generated at a very unreasonable rate!).

	The application shall not contain target-dependent code, such
	as assembly code, because it runs as a regular executable
	compiled by GCC on a GNU/Linux workstation. It cannot be
	possible to use the MVM to collect accurate performance
	footprints of your system, but it may show you precisely how
	the multiple threads running in your system work together
	sharing the resources of the real-time interface.

config RTAI_MVM_GCC_TARBALL
	string "GCC tarball"
	depends on RTAI_MVM
	default "/tmp/gcc-2.95.3.tar.bz2"
	help
	
	In order to be able to instrument your code and debug it using
	the Minute Virtual Machine (MVM), you need a special compiler
	called gcic. This particular tool is based on a patched gcc
	whose archive directory has to be specified here.
	The default value is /tmp/gcc-2.95.3.tar.bz2.

config RTAI_MVM_DEBUG
	bool "MVM debug support"
	depends on RTAI_MVM && RTAI_EXTENDED
	default n
	help
	
	This option activates runtime checking of the event-driven
	simulator state. Do not activate it unless you really intend
	to debug the Minute Virtual Machine.
