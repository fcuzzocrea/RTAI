Virtual RTAI
============

Virtual RTAI is the original rtai_sched and rt_mem_mgr modules that
have been ported directly to the Xenomai's virtual machine.  Simply
put, RTAI's RTHAL have been replaced by Xenomai's MVM layer, so the
RTAI scheduler is fooled, thinking it runs on the real hardware.

The MVM provides RTAI's UP-scheduler with the low-level resources it
needs to schedule tasks, handle interrupts, manage memory and so on,
so it eventually thinks it runs on real hardware.

The main virtue of this port is to allow writing the
hardware-independent part of a kernel-based RTAI application in
userland, using the RTOS-aware Xenoscope GUI to debug it.

RTAI's UP-scheduler port on top of the MVM is labeled with the
original RTAI version followed by -sr<N> for "simulator revision",
where N is the VRTAI release increment.
The current label is 24.1.8-sr1.
