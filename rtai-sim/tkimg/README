This directory contains a Tcl package adding some image types to Tk
that are needed by the Xenoscope GUI.

The code herein was respectiveky lifted from libimg1.2.4 written by
Jan Nijtmans <j.nijtmans@chello.nl> and Bruce Stephens's
<bruce@cenderis.demon.co.uk> compound image package.

Those contributions have merely been merged in a single one, and
libimg has been stripped down, only keeping the PNG, XPM, PS and PDF
support.

Using this package requires libz and libpng installed on the system.
